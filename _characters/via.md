## Description

Via is the head of Lumin Academy's magic research department, specializing in fire magic but excelling in all studies. Despite not having massive potential, she has become the most important mage in the kingdom due to her deep understanding of magic. Currently, she is being loaned to Kaji to assist her and act as a spy for her kingdom. Kaji often overworks Via to the point of not sleeping for days, resulting in her clumsiness and narcoleptic tendencies. Kaji forces her to work overtime using multiple devices to ensure this behavior, which might be unethical, but Via manages.

## Abilities

**Spirit Blessing:**  
Via and her family have been blessed by fire spirits, granting them exceptional compatibility with all fire spells. Via has harnessed this blessing by integrating her research and theoretical knowledge into practical applications, significantly enhancing her fire magic abilities.

**Magic Knowledge:**  
Her deep understanding of magic allows her to quickly decipher and break down spells, identify weaknesses, and even spot curses before they affect her. This mastery extends to magical tools and enchantments as well.

**Sleep Walker:**  
As a consequence of her overworked schedule, Via has developed narcolepsy. When she unexpectedly falls asleep, her body performs routine tasks through muscle memory, though this makes complex new spell work challenging.
